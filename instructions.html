    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

        Hello and welcome to our study. In this study you will have to react as fast and as accurate as possible. You
        will see images like this:
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="stimulus" style="color: yellow">green</div>
    </div>
    <div>
        Note that the meaning of the word is "green", while the print color is "yellow".
    </div>
    <div id="start_block">
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h2>In this case the correct answer is <span id="correct_1"></span></h2>
        <div class="stimulus" style="color: red">blue</div>
    </div>
    <div id="end_block">
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h2>In this case the correct answer is <span id="correct_2"></span></h2>
        <div class="stimulus" style="color: green">blue</div>
    </div>
    <div id="reaction">
        You will have to react by pressing buttons 'c', 'd', 'n', and 'j' on the keyboard. The key to color mapping will
        be explained before
        the experiment starts. Please put your left index finger on the 'c' key, your left middle finger on the 'd' key,
        your right index finger
        on the 'n' key and the right middle finger on the 'j' key during the experiment.
